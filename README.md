# nixdots
This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. It isn't meant to be for everyone or really anyone but myself, as such I wouldn't recomend running it, it would be better just to take things that you like from it. However, you are free to run it anyway just don't expect support outside of bugs, if something doesn't work the way you want it that's your problem unless I agree that it is a problem. That isn't to say I don't want suggestions, if you find a program or config I might like PLEASE tell me about it in issues, just note that I might not use it as it's made for me and my preferences not you.

## Installation:
Please note that unless you have a AMD GPU, 165Hz monitor, same username and the same disk name as well you might need to do some hacking. As of now I haven't rewrote the installion instructions to take flakes into account.

## TODO: 
- Rewrite instructions
- Finalize NeoVim configs
- Look into VimWiki
- Write configs for laptop "server" for some kind of file server and sync
- Declare Firefox/Floorp configurations
- Add hosts file back, maybe with a Systemd job to update them
- Look into disabling the 2nd display when in tty
- Later look into replacing login manager with Cosmic one if it becomes viable
- Consider switching to Cosmic completely when it's fully out and has good Nix support
- Install and setup Open Tablet Driver
- Write config for server and phone via termux fork and flakes
- Organize code
- Generally clean code
