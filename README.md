## TODO:
- Write config for server and phone via termux fork and flakes

- Check that comment style is consistent e.g. same wording
- Add Ranger or Joshuto config

## Installation

# Please note that unless you have a AMD GPU, 165Hz monitor, same username and the same disk name as well you might need to do some hacking

# TODO: 
- Rewrite instructions
- Integrate local AI model with Ollama
- Finalize NeoVim configs
- Stop using Codium and Nano
- Look into dedicated graphical NeoVim client
- Look into VimWiki
- Write configs for laptop "server" for some kind of file server and sync
- Correctly configure wallpapers and add slideshow etc.
- Add Waybar
- Declare Firefox/Floorp configurations
- Setup Japanese input (again)
- Setup screenshotting, ideally with Flameshot... Good luck with that
- Look into how hard it would be to edit desktop files of Electron apps to make them run Wayland native (XWayland is good enough though)
- Add hosts file back, maybe with a Systemd job to update them
- Fix login screen showing Systemd messages on first boot
- Add tty theme
- Look into disabling the 2nd display when in tty
- Later look into replacing login manager with Cosmic one if it becomes viable
- Consider switching to Cosmic completely when it's fully out and has good Nix support
- Install and setup Open Tablet Driver
