# Please note that unless you have a AMD GPU, 165Hz monitor, same username and the same disk name as well you might need to do some hacking

# TODO: 
- Rewrite instructions
- Finalize NeoVim configs
- Look into VimWiki
- Write configs for laptop "server" for some kind of file server and sync
- Declare Firefox/Floorp configurations
- Add hosts file back, maybe with a Systemd job to update them
- Fix login screen showing Systemd messages on first boot
- Add tty theme
- Look into disabling the 2nd display when in tty
- Later look into replacing login manager with Cosmic one if it becomes viable
- Consider switching to Cosmic completely when it's fully out and has good Nix support
- Install and setup Open Tablet Driver
- Write config for server and phone via termux fork and flakes
- Organize code
- Generally clean code 
- Check that comment style is consistent e.g. same wording
- Add Ranger or Joshuto config
